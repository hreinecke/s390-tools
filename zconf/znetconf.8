.SH NAME
znetconf \- list and configure network devices for System z network adapters

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B znetconf
.B [-h|--help] [-v|--version]
.br

.br
.B znetconf -u | -c
.br
.B znetconf -a <device_bus_id>[,...]{2} [-o <ATTR>=<VALUE>]+ [-d <DRIVER>]
.br
.B znetconf -A [-o <ATTR>=<VALUE>]+ [-d <DRIVER>] [-e <device_bus_id>]+
.br
.B znetconf -r <device_bus_id> [-n] | -R [-n] [-e <device_bus_id>]+


.SH DESCRIPTION
The znetconf command lists and automatically configures network devices for
System z network adapters. It senses and lists potential
network devices that are not yet configured or already configured.
Based on these lists, it automatically adds or removes network devices.
.P
For automatic configuration, znetconf builds a channel command word
(CCW) group device from sensed CCW devices, configures any specified
option through the sensed network device driver and sets the new
network device online.
.P
During automatic removal, znetconf sets the device offline and removes it.
Be aware that removing all network devices leads to the
complete loss of network connectivity. So a terminal session (e.g. 3270)
might be required to restore.

.TP
.BR -a | --add " <device_bus_id>[,<device_bus_id>)][,<device_bus_id>]
[-o | --option <ATTR>=<VALUE>]+ [-d | --driver <DRIVER>]
.br

.br
Add the potential network device identified by device_bus_id.
device_bus_id can be any of the device
IDs listed as part of the potential network device list (argument
.BR -u ")."
For example, if znetconf
.BR -u
lists 0.0.f503,0.0.f504,0.0.f505 for a potential network device, device_bus_id
may be 0.0.f503 or 0.0.f504 or 0.0.f505.
If a device bus-ID begins with 0.0., you can abbreviate it to the final
hexadecimal digits. For example, you can abbreviate 0.0.f503 to f503.
.br
.br
If attribute value pairs are given with
.BR -o ", "
these pairs are configured for the created network device. The
device is then set online regardless of whether the given attribute value pairs
were applied successfully.
.br
Finally, the corresponding network interface name (e.g. eth1) is displayed.
.br
If more then one device_bus_id is given, the given set of devices is configured as a network device. znetconf tries to sense the required device driver
automatically. If the device driver cannot be sensed, you must specify it with
-d.
.BR -d "."
With
.BR -d
znetconf does NOT check the validity of the combination of device bus-IDs.

.TP
.BR -A | --addall " [-o | --option <ATTR>=<VALUE>]+ [-d | --driver DRIVER]"
[-e | --except <device_bus_id>]+
.br

.br
Add all potential network devices. If one or more device_bus_id are specified
with
.BR -e ", "
the corresponding network devices are not added.
Attribute value pairs given with
.BR -o
are configured for the network devices before they are set
online. If the configuration of one potential network device fails,
znetconf continues with the next remaining potential network device.

.TP
.BR -r | --remove " <device_bus_id> [-n | --non-interactive]"
Remove the network device identified by device_bus_id. device_bus_id is one of
the device IDs of the network device. They are listed as part of znetconf
.BR -c "."
znetconf sets the device offline and removes it. If
.BR -n
is given, all confirmation questions are answered with 'yes'.

.TP
.BR -R|--removall " [-n | --non-interactive] [-e | --except <device_bus_id>]+"
Remove all network devices. If
.BR -n
is given, all confirmation questions are answered with 'yes'. To exclude
certain devices from the removal, their device bus-IDs have to be given
with
.BR -e ". "

.TP
\fB<ATTR>\fR
Specify a device option. The option must match a sysfs attribute for the device
to be configured. For a detailed description of the semantics of sysfs 
attributes please refer to the Device Drivers, Features, and Commands book for 
Linux on System z. The attributes are:

\fB<device_bus_id>\fR
Specify the device bus-ID of a CCW device. Device bus-IDs have the form
([A-Fa-f0-9].[A-Fa-f0-9].)[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}.

If a device bus-ID begins with 0.0., you can abbreviate it to the final
hexadecimal digits.

For example, you can abbreviate 0.0.f503 to f503.

.TP
\fB<DRIVER>\fR
Specify the device driver for the device. Valid values are qeth, lcs, ctc, or
ctcm.
