.SH DESCRIPTION

Address Range
Start and end address of the memory range.
.
.TP 4
Size
Size of the memory range in MB (1024 x 1024 bytes).
.
.TP 4
State
Indication of the online status of the memory range. State on->off means
that the address range is in transition from online to offline.
.
.TP 4
Removable
"yes" if the memory range can be set offline, "no" if it cannot be set offline.
A dash ("\-") means that the range is already offline.
.
.TP 4
Device
Device number or numbers that correspond to the memory range.

Each device represents a memory unit for the hypervisor in control of the
memory. The hypervisor cannot reuse a memory unit unless the corresponding
memory range is completely offline. For best memory utilization, each device
should either be completely online or completely offline.

The chmem command with the size parameter automatically chooses the best suited
device or devices when setting memory online or offline. The device size depends
on the hypervisor and on the amount of total online and offline memory.
