.SH NAME
chmem \- set memory online or offline.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chmem
.RB OPTIONS
.RB [SIZE|RANGE]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The chmem command sets a particular size or range of memory online or offline.
.
.IP "\(hy" 2
Specify SIZE as <size>[m|M|g|G]. With m or M, <size> specifies the memory
size in MB (1024 x 1024 bytes). With g or G, <size> specifies the memory size
in GB (1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes). The default unit is MB.
.
.IP "\(hy" 2
Specify RANGE in the form 0x<start>-0x<end> as shown in the output of the
lsmem command. <start> is the hexadecimal address of the first byte and <end>
is the hexadecimal address of the last byte in the memory range.
.
.PP
SIZE and RANGE must be aligned to the Linux memory block size, as shown in
the output of the lsmem command.

Setting memory online can fail if the hypervisor does not have enough memory
left, for example because memory was overcommitted. Setting memory offline can
fail if Linux cannot free the memory. If only part of the requested memory can
be set online or offline, a message tells you how much memory was set online
or offline instead of the requested amount.
