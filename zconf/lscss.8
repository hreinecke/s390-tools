.TH LSCSS 8 "Mar 2009" "s390-tools"

.SH NAME
lscss \- list channel subsystem devices.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 16
.B lscss \fI<options>\fR \fI[RANGE]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The lscss command is used to list all or a subset of devices that are managed
by the common I/O subsystem.

.SH [RANGE]
Limit output to a range of subchannels by specifying
multiple identifiers as a comma-separated list or a
range or a combination of both, e.g.

	0.0.1234-0.0.1235,4711


Note that ranges may also be separated by spaces.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BR -s | --short
Shorten IDs by removing leading "0.0.". Note: only IDs beginning with "0.0."
will be displayed in this case.

.TP 8
.BR -t | --devtype " " \fI<devtype>[/<model>][,...]\fR
For IO subchannels, limit output to devices of the given device type
(e.g. 3390).

.TP 8
.BR -d | --devrange
Indicate that RANGE refers to device identifiers.

.TP 8
.BR --avail
Show availability attribute of IO devices.

.TP 8
.BR --vpm
Show verified path mask.
VPM is an internal path mask used by Linux. A channel path can be used by Linux device drivers
to do IO if the corresponding bit is set in the VPM. Events that can lead to a channel path
not being available include:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 4
The corresponding bit is not set in at least one of the PIM, PAM, or POM masks.
.IP \[bu]
The channel path is varied offline.
.IP \[bu]
Linux received no interrupt to IO using this channel path.
.RE

.TP 8
.BR -h | --help
Print help text.

.TP 8
.BR -u | --uppercase
Print values using uppercase.

.TP 8
.BR --io
Show IO subchannels. (default)

.TP 8
.BR --chsc
Show CHSC subchannels.

.TP 8
.BR --eadm
Show EADM subchannels.

.TP 8
.BR -a | --all
Show subchannels of all types.


.SH EXAMPLES
\fBlscss\fR
.RS
List all devices that are managed by the common I/O subsystem.
.RE

\fBlscss -t 3390\fR
.RS
Same as above but shows only 3390 devices.
.RE

.SH NOTES
In rare situations a device might temporarily not be accessible to
the subchannel. Then "none" is displayed as the device identifier and the
other device attributes are empty.
