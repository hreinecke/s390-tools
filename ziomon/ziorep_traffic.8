.SH OUTPUT
Here is a list of the columns and their descriptions.
Timestamps of the frames printed depict the ending of the respective timeframe.

.TP
.BR "I/O rt MB/s"
I/O rate of the respective device in megabytes per second, considering individual requests and their total processing time, including channel latency, etc.
.br
.IR "min" " and " "max"
give the minimum and maximum respectively.

.TP
.BR "thrp in MB/s"
Throughput of the respective device in megabytes per second, considering times of activity only.
.br
.IR "avg" " and " "stdev"
give the average utilization as well as its standard deviation respectively.

.TP
.BR "I/O requests"
Statistics on the numbers and kinds of I/O requests seen.
.br
.IR "#reqs"
is the total number of requests,
.br
.IR "rd"
is the number of read requests,
.br
.IR "wrt"
is the number of write requests and
.br
.IR "bidi"
is the number of bi-directional requests.

.TP
.BR "I/O subs. lat. in us"
Latency of the I/O subsystem in microseconds. This is the time needed to execute a request, from the I/O stack down to the hardware and back up again.
.br
.IR "min" ", " "max" ", " "avg" " and " "stdev"
give the minimum, maximum and average latency as well as its standard deviation respectively.

.TP
.BR "channel lat. in us"
Channel latency in microseconds. This is the time needed to execute a request on the FCP adapter.
.br
.IR "min" ", " "max" ", " "avg" " and " "stdev"
give the minimum, maximum and average latency as well as its standard deviation respectively.

.TP
.BR "fabric lat. in us"
Fabric latency in microseconds. This is the time needed for the requests within the fabric, from the FCP adapter to the target device and back again.
.br
.IR "min" ", " "max" ", " "avg" " and " "stdev"
give the minimum, maximum and average latency as well as its standard deviation respectively.


.SH EXAMPLES
.B Example
.br
Print a traffic report for all devices.
Only data after 8:57 April 5, 2008 should be considered.
Data should be aggregated to 60 second intervals.

ziorep_traffic -i 60 -b "2008-04-05 08:57" sample.log

.B Example
.br
Print a detailed traffic report for all devices connected to target port 0x500507630313c562.
Data should be aggregated over the whole data range.

ziorep_traffic -i 0 -p 0x500507630313c562 sample.log

.B Example
.br
Print a detailed traffic report for all devices that are either connected to target port 0x500507630313c562 or part of multipath device 36005076303ffc5620000000000001314.
The result should be collapsed on the bus-ID level.

ziorep_traffic -C u -p 0x500507630313c562 -m 36005076303ffc5620000000000001314 sample.log
