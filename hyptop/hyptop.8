.TH HYPTOP 8 "Nov 2009" "s390-tools"
.SH NAME
hyptop \- Show hypervisor performance data on System z

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hyptop
[OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hyptop
provides a dynamic real-time view of a hypervisor environment on System z.
It works with either the z/VM or the LPAR hypervisor. Depending on the available
data it shows for example CPU and memory information about running LPARs or
z/VM guests.

hyptop provides two windows:
.IP "     -"
sys_list: Shows a list of systems that the hypervisor is currently running
.IP "     -"
sys: Shows one system in more detail.

.PP
You can run hyptop in interactive mode (default) or in batch mode with
the "\-b" option. For how to use the interactive mode, see the online help
(enter "?" after hyptop is started).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Print usage information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-v" " or " "\-\-version"
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-w <WINDOW NAME>" " or " "\-\-window=<WINDOW NAME>"
Select current window. Use the options "--sys", "--fields", and "--sort" to
modify the current window. The last window specified with the "--window" option
will be used as start window. The default window is "sys_list".
.TP
.BR "\-s <SYSTEM>,..." " or " "\-\-sys=<SYSTEM>,..."
Select systems for current window. If this option is specified, only the
selected systems are shown for the window. For window "sys" only one
system can be specified.
.TP
.BR "\-f <F_LETTER>[:<UNIT>],..." " or " "\-\-fields=<F_LETTER>[:<UNIT>],..."
Select fields and units in the current window. "F_LETTER" is the field
letter that identifies uniquely a field (for example "c" for CPU time).
"UNIT" is the used entity for displaying data for the field (for example "us"
for microseconds). See FIELDS and UNITS below for definitions.
If the "--fields" option is specified, only the selected fields are
shown.
.TP
.BR "\-S <F_LETTER>" " or " "\-\-sort=<F_LETTER>"
Select sort field for current window. To reverse the sort order, specify the
option twice. See FIELDS below for definitions.
.TP
.BR "\-t <TYPE>,..." " or " "\-\-cpu_types=<TYPE>,..."
Select CPU types that are used for CPU time calculations. See CPU TYPES
below for definitions.
.TP
.BR "\-b" " or " "\-\-batch_mode"
Use batch mode (no curses). This can be useful for sending output from hyptop
to another program, a file, or a line mode terminal.
In this mode no user input is accepted.
.TP
.BR "\-d <SECONDS>" " or " "\-\-delay=<SECONDS>"
Specifies the delay between screen updates.
.TP
.BR "\-n <ITERATIONS>" " or " "\-\-iterations=<ITERATIONS>"
Specifies the maximum number of iterations before ending.

.SH PREREQUISITES
The following things are required to run hyptop:

.IP "     -"
The Linux kernel must have the required support to  provide  the
performance data.
.IP "     -"
debugfs has to be mounted.
.IP "     -"
The hyptop user must have read permission for the required debugfs files.
.IP "     -"
To monitor all LPARs or z/VM guest operating systems of the hypervisor,
your system must have additional permissions:
For z/VM, the guest virtual machine must be class B. For LPAR, on the HMC or
SE security menu of the LPAR activation profile, select the Global performance
data control checkbox.

.PP
To mount debugfs, you can use this command:

# mount none -t debugfs /sys/kernel/debug

To make this persistent, add the following to "/etc/fstab":

none     /sys/kernel/debug       debugfs defaults        0 0


.SH FIELDS
The supported fields depend on the available data  on  the  hypervisor.
This  is  different  between LPAR and z/VM. It might also depend on
machine type, z/VM version and kernel version. Each field has a  unique
field  letter  that can be used to select the field in interactive mode
or through the "--fields" command line option.

The following fields are available under LPAR:

  In "sys_list" and "sys" window:
  'c' - CPU time per second
  'm' - Management time per second
  'C' - Total CPU time
  'M' - Total management time
  'o' - Online time

  In "sys_list" window:
  '#' - Number of CPUs

  In "sys" window:
  'p' - CPU type
  'v' - Visualization of CPU time per second

The following fields are available under z/VM:

  In "sys_list" and "sys" window:
  'c' - CPU time per second
  'C' - Total CPU time
  'o' - Online time

  In "sys_list" window:
  '#' - Number of CPUs
  'u' - Used memory
  'a' - Maximum memory
  'n' - Minimum weight
  'r' - Current weight
  'x' - Maximum weight

  In "sys" window:
  'v' - Visualization of CPU time per second

.SH UNITS
Depending on the field type the values can be displayed in different units.
The following units are supported:

  Time:
  'us'  - Microseconds (10^-6 seconds)
  'ms'  - Millisconds (10^-3 seconds)
  '%'   - Hundreds of a second (10^-2 seconds) or percent
  's'   - Seconds
  'm'   - Minutes
  'hm'  - Hours & Minutes
  'dhm' - Days & Hours & Minutes

  Memory:
  'kib' - Kibibytes (1.024 bytes)
  'mib' - Mebibytes (1.048.576 bytes)
  'gib' - Gibibytes (1.073.741.824 bytes)

  Miscellaneous:
  'str' - String
  '#'   - Count/Number
  'vis' - Visualization

.SH CPU TYPES
Depending on the hypervisor different CPU types are supported. These CPU
types can be selected either interactively or with the "--cpu_types"
command line option. The calculation of the CPU data only uses CPUs of
the specified types.

On LPAR the following CPU types are supported:
   'IFL' - Integrated Facility for Linux
   'CP'  - CP processor type
   'UN'  - Unspecified processor type (other than CP or IFL)

NOTE: It is possible that on older machines also IFLs are shown as CPs.
On z/VM currently only the processor type 'UN' is available.

.SH EXAMPLES
To start hyptop with the "sys_list" window in interactive mode, enter:

.br

  # hyptop -b

.br
To start hyptop with the "sys_list" window in interactive mode with the fields
CPU time (in milliseconds) and online time (unit default) and sort the
output according to online time, enter:
.br

  # hyptop -f c:ms,o -S o

.br
To start hyptop with the "sys" window with system "MYLPAR" with the fields CPU
time (unit milliseconds) and online time  (unit  default)  and  sort  the
output reverse according the online time, enter:
.br

  # hyptop -w sys -s MYLPAR -f c:ms,o -S o -S o

.br
To start hyptop with the "sys_list" window in batch mode with update delay 5
seconds and 10 iterations, enter:
.br

  # hyptop -b -d 5 -n 10

.br
To start  hyptop with the "sys_list" window and use only CPU types IFL and CP
for CPU time calculation, enter:

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B TERM
The TERM environment variable specifies your terminal type. To run
\fBhyptop\fP in interactive mode the TERM environment variable has
to be set. The interactive mode is not available for terminals that
have TERM=dumb (e.g. line mode terminals).
