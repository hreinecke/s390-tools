.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtape390_display\fR displays one or two 8-byte messages on the display
unit of a zSeries tape device.  Characters to be displayed include capital
letters A-Z, numerics 0-9 and special characters.
However some special characters may not display on all device types. The
characters that should display on model 3490 are:
.br
	'@$#,./()*&+-=%|:_<>?;' and the <cent> character.
.br
Spaces and shell-sensitive characters have to be quoted.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
\fB-h\fR or \fB--help\fR
Print help text.

.TP
\fB-b\fR or \fB--blink\fR
Display \fImessage1\fR repeatedly for 2 seconds at half-second intervals.
This option is ignored if two messages are specified on command line.

.TP
\fB-l\fR or \fB--load\fR
If this option is given the display request will cause a load request to be
sent to the automatic tape loader (if installed). The next indexed tape will
then be loaded if the loader is in 'system' mode. Otherwise the request is
ignored.

.TP
\fB-q\fR or \fB--quiet\fR
This option causes the command to run in quiet mode which will suppress
all warning messages.

.TP
\fB-t\fR \fItype\fR or \fB--type\fR \fItype\fR
Set the type of the message to be displayed. This influences how long
the message(s) stay on the display. Available types are:

.RS
.TP 16
.B standard
The message(s) stay displayed until the drive executes the next tape
movement command. This is the default.
.TP
.B load
Displays the message(s) until a tape is loaded. If there already is
a tape loaded to the device, nothing is displayed at all.
.TP
.B unload
This will display the message(s) until currently loaded tape is unloaded.
Again, if the drive \fIis\fR currently unloaded there is no output at all.
.TP
.B noop
For testing purposes only, this will access the drive but won't do anything
at all (no operation). This doesn't seem to work with 3590 tape devices.
.TP
.B reload
This display type \fBrequires\fR two messages. The first message is
displayed as long as there is a tape loaded up to the time the unload
operation is completed (or, if there isn't a tape loaded, it will be
ignored). The second message is displayed as soon as a tape gets loaded
into the drive.
.RE

.TP
\fB-v\fR or \fB--version\fR
Print the S/390 tools package version, the utility version and exit.

.TP 8
\fBmessage1\fR [ \fBmessage2\fR ]
The message(s) to be displayed. They stay displayed until either the
ending condition for the message type takes place or the display is
updated with another message.
.br
If two messages are specified, they are alternated on the display.
Each message is then displayed repeatedly for 2 seconds
at half-second intervals. 

.TP
\fBdevice\fR
The tape device on which the message(s) will be displayed, e.g.:
.sp
	\fB/dev/ntibm\fR\fI0\fR
.br

.SH EXAMPLES
\fBtape390_display --blink --type unload "TESTING" /dev/ntibm\fR\fI0\fR
.RS
Let the message TESTING blink on the display of the tape unit until the
tape is removed (or another message is given). If there is no tape in the
drive, nothing happens.
.RE
\fBtape390_display "BACKUP" "COMPLETE" /dev/ntibm\fR\fI0\fR
.RS
This will display the messages BACKUP and COMPLETE each for 2 seconds
until the tape is moved, ejected or (if there isn't a tape in the
device) inserted.
.RE
\fBtape390_display --type reload "UNLOAD" "LOAD" /dev/ntibm\fT\fI0\fR
.RS
The UNLOAD message will be displayed if there is a tape inserted and as
long as the tape isn't removed. After that the LOAD message is displayed
until a tape is inserted. If there is no tape inserted when the command
.RE
\fBtape390_display --load --type load "LOADING" /dev/ntibm\fT\fI0\fR
.RS
Causes the device to display the message LOADING until a tape is inserted
and to instruct the automatic stacker to load the next tape (if the mode
of operation is \fIsystem\fR). If there already is a tape loaded, nothing
will happen at all.
