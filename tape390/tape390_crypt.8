.TH TAPE390_CRYPT 8 "Apr 2006" "s390-tools"

.SH NAME
tape390_crypt \- encryption support for zSeries tape devices.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tape390_crypt
[OPTION] [DEVICE]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tape390_crypt 
exploits encryption features available in zSeries tape devices.
It can be used to enable or disable tape encryption and to set
KEK (Key Encrypting Key) labels.	

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h" " or " "\-\-help"
Print help information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-v" " or " "\-\-version"
Print version information, then exit.

.TP
.BR "\-q" " or " "\-\-query"
Print current encryption status of the specified tape device and of the 
loaded medium.
If encryption is on and the medium is encrypted , 
additional information on the encryption keys is displayed.

.TP
.BR "\-e " { "on" | "off" } " " or " \-\-encryption=" { "on" | "off" } 
sets tape encryption on or off.

.TP
.BR "\-k <value>" [ "<char>label" | "<char>hash" ] " " or " \-\-key=<value>" [ "<char>label" | "<char>hash" ]
sets tape encryption keys.
.br 
<value> specifies the KEK
(Key Encrypting Key), which can be maximal 64 characters long.
.br
The store type (either label or hash) specifies how the KEK in <value> is to be stored on the tape medium. Since labels are
human readable strings and hence more user friendly than hashes, 
the default store type is label.
.br
The -k option can only be specified, if the tape medium is at load point.
.br
While processing the -k option, the tape medium is initialized and all
data eventually contained on the tape medium is lost. 
To avoid inadvertent data loss a prompt message is issued asking the user 
whether he or she really wants to proceed. 
.br
The -k option can be specified maximal twice, because on the tape medium
maximal two EEDKs (External Encrypted Data Keys) can be stored. 
If specified once, two identical EEDKs are stored.
.br
<char> is a character separating the KEK in <value> from the store type 
(either label or hash). This
delimiter can be specified with the -d option as explained below.

.TP
.BR "\-d <char>" " or " "\-\-delimiter=<char>
specifies the character which separates the KEK
in  <value> from the store type (either label or hash).
The default delimiter is : (colon).
The \-d option can only be specified together with the \-k option. 

.TP
.BR "\-f " " or " "\-\-force
specifies that no prompt message is to be issued before writing the KEK   
information and initializing the tape medium.
The \-f option can only be specified together with the \-k option.

.TP
.BR device
specifies the device node of the tape device.

.SH EXAMPLES
1. Scenario: 
.br
mount non-encrypted tape and write data with the 
.B "default" 
KEKs:
.br
tape390_crypt -e on /dev/ntibm0
.br
tar cfz /dev/ntibm0 /data

2. Scenario: 
.br
mount non-encrypted tape and write data with 
.B "specific"
KEKs:
.br
tape390_crypt -k my_first_key -k my_second_key:hash /dev/ntibm0
.br
tar cfz /dev/ntibm0 /data

3. Scenario: 
.br
mount tape and display current encryption status:
.br
tape390_crypt -q /dev/ntibm0
