## Path:		System/Dumpconf
## Description:		Configures the actions which should be performed after a kernel panic
## Type:		list(stop,dump,vmcmd,reipl,dump_reipl)
## Default:		"stop"
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the action that should be taken if a panic happens.
#
# The following actions are supported:
#
# * stop:	Stop Linux (default)
# * dump:	Dump Linux
# * vmcmd:	Issue z/VM CP commands
# * reipl:	Re-IPL Linux using setting under /sys/firmware/reipl
# * dump_reipl:	First dump Linux, then re-IPL Linux using setting under
#		/sys/firmware/reipl
#
ON_PANIC="stop"

## Type:		integer(0:300)
## Default:		5
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Using reipl or dump_reipl actions with ON_PANIC can lead to the system
# looping with alternating IPLs and crashes. Use DELAY_MINUTES to prevent
# such a loop. DELAY_MINUTES delays activating the specified panic action
# for a newly started system. When the specified time has elapsed, dumpconf
# activates the specified panic action. This action is taken should the
# system subsequently crash. If the system crashes before the time has
# elapsed the previously defined action is taken. If no previous action has
# been defined the default action (STOP) is performed.
#
DELAY_MINUTES="5"

## Type:		list(ccw,fcp)
## Default:		""
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the type, ccw for DASD and fcp for zFCP.
#
DUMP_TYPE=""

## Type:		string
## Default:		""
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the device id for a DASD or SCSI over zFCP dump device.
#
# For example (DASD and SCSI over zFCP have the same structure): DEVICE=0.0.4711
#
DEVICE=""

## Type:		string
## Default:		""
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the WWPN for a zFCP dump device.
#
# For example: WWPN=0x5005076303004711
#
WWPN=""

## Type:		string
## Default:		""
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the LUN for a zFCP dump device.
#
# For example: LUN=0x4711000000000000
#
LUN=""

## Type:		integer(0:30)
## Default:		"0"
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the Boot program selector for a zFCP dump device.
#
# A decimal value between 0 and 30 specifying the program to be loaded from
# the FCP-I/O device.
#
BOOTPROG="0"

## Type:		string
## Default:		"0"
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# Define the Boot record logical block address for a zFCP dump device.
#
# The hexadecimal digits designating the logical-block address of the boot record of the FCP-I/O device.
# It must be a value from 0-FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF. For values longer than 8 hex characters at least one separator
# blank is required after the 8th character.
#
BR_LBA="0"

## Type:		string
## Default:		""
## ServiceRestart:	dumpconf
#
# VMCMD_<X>
# Specifies a CP command, <X> is a number from one to eight. You can
# specify up to eight CP commands that are executed in case of a kernel
# panic. Note that VM commands, device adresses, and VM guest names
# must be uppercase.
