# s390 dump config
#
# Configures the actions which should be performed after a kernel panic
# and on PSW restart.
#
# The following actions are supported:
#
# * stop:       Stop Linux (default)
# * dump:       Dump Linux with stand-alone dump tool
# * vmcmd:      Issue z/VM CP commands
# * reipl:      Re-IPL Linux using setting under /sys/firmware/reipl
# * dump_reipl: First dump Linux with stand-alone dump tool, then re-IPL Linux
#               using setting under /sys/firmware/reipl
#

# For the actions "reipl" and "dump_reipl" the DELAY_MINUTES keyword may
# be used to delay the activation of dumpconf.
# Thus potential reipl loops caused by kernel panics
# which persistently occur early in the boot process can be prevented.

# Dump on CCW device (DASD) and re-IPL after dump is complete.
# The re-IPL device, as specified under "/sys/firmware/reipl", is used.
# The activation of dumpconf is delayed by 5 minutes.
#
# ON_PANIC=dump_reipl
# DUMP_TYPE=ccw
# DEVICE=0.0.4e13
# DELAY_MINUTES=5

#
# Dump on fcp device (SCSI Disk)
#
# ON_PANIC=dump
# DUMP_TYPE=fcp
# DEVICE=0.0.4711
# WWPN=0x5005076303004711
# LUN=0x4711000000000000
# BOOTPROG=0

#
# Use VMDUMP
#
# ON_PANIC=vmcmd
# VMCMD_1="MESSAGE * Starting VMDUMP"
# VMCMD_2="VMDUMP"
# VMCMD_3="IPL 4711"

#
# Stop Linux (default)
#
# ON_PANIC=stop

#
# Re-IPL Linux
# The re-IPL device, as specified under "/sys/firmware/reipl", is used.
# Since the DELAY_MINUTES keyword is omitted, there is no delay and
# dumpconf becomes active immediately during system startup.
#
# ON_PANIC=reipl
