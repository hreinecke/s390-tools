/**
 * @mainpage
 * The libzds is a s390-tools internal library for use with DASD
 * devices in raw_track_access mode.
 *
 * The regular operation mode of the DASD device driver allows only to
 * access ECKD DASDs that were formatted with a specific record
 * layout.  The raw access mode of the DASD device driver allows to
 * access any kind of ECKD DASD, but requires the correct use of
 * the DIRECT_IO interface and leaves the interpretation of the data
 * format on these devices to the user.
 *
 * This library supports the use of raw DASD devices by providing
 * functions that
 * @li access the device with DIRECT_IO and the correct buffer alignment
 * @li provide access to label and VTOC data on the device
 * @li provide access to simple z/OS data set formats
 *     (physical sequential (PS) and partitioned data sets (PDS))
 *
 *
 * @section interface_groups Library Interface
 *
 * @subsection interface_structures Data Structures
 *
 * The data structures provided by this library can be divided into
 * two types: Structures that represent external hardware and software
 * interfaces, and structures that are defined by libzds itself:
 *
 * @ref external_interfaces
 *
 * @ref libzds_data
 *
 *
 * @subsection interface_functions Functions
 *
 * The functions provided by this library are divided into 5 categories:
 * base, low, mid, and highlevel functions and helper functions.
 *
 * The lower the level, the less dependent are the functions on the data
 * that is stored on the DASDs. The higher the level the more abstract
 * are the implemented concepts.
 *
 * The base level functions are needed to setup the internal data
 * structures which the other functions work on. Otherwise, he use of higher
 * level functions does not require the use of low level functions.
 * For example: To simply read data from a data set, you just need the
 * base and high level functions and can ignore the low and mid level
 * functions.
 *
 * \ref libzds_functions_base
 *
 * \ref libzds_functions_low
 *
 * \ref libzds_functions_mid
 *
 * \ref libzds_functions_high
 *
 * \ref libzds_functions_helper
 *
 *
 * @section naming_scheme Naming Scheme
 *
 * All interface functions start with lzds_ for libzds (could be changed later
 * but libzds_ is quite long). Next is the entity the function works on,
 * for example
 * @li @c lzds_zdsroot_...
 * @li @c lzds_dasd_...
 *
 * So if you know what entity you want to work on, you know where to look.
 *
 * Then follows the operation (add, get, read, alloc, ...).
 * There are several verbs that can mean 'access data'.
 * As a guideline we define the following meaning for use in this library:
 * @li read: Will result in data being read from a device
 * @li get: Get a value from one of the internal structures
 * @li extract: Use the internal data to create higher level data,
 *              e.g. use the VTOC information of a DASD to create data
 *              set structures
 * @li alloc: Create and return a libzds data structure
 *
 * @note For every alloc function there shall be a matching free function to
 * release the memory. However, often the structure is created in the
 * context of a another structure, but when it is freed, that is done in
 * its own context. For example:
 * lzds_zdsroot_alloc_dasditerator is matched by lzds_dasditerator_free
 *
 * Finally the object of the operation, what you want to get or achieve,
 *  e.g lzds_ds_get_is_PDS
 *
 * For the parmeter list, the general rule is:
 * The subject comes first, the object last, further parameters in between.
