# user ID filter with some exotic user ID names
#
# z/VM user ID consists mainly of alphanumeric characters.
# Additional characters like @#_-$ are also allowed. However, @ and # are not
# recommended. Additional characters can be configured.
#
# To use a common set of all the values possible, the iucv terminal tools
# uses alphnumeric and underscore. The chiucvallow program also allows to use
# the dollar sign ($).
#
# All other characters must not be used.
#
#
NORMAL
# underscores are allowed
WITH_
# dollar sign is allowed for chiucvallow only
