.SH NAME
vmcp \- send commands to the z/VM control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI vmcp
[\fI-k\fR] [\fI-b <size>\fR] command

.BI vmcp
[\fI-h|-v\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
vmcp allows Linux users to send commands to the control program of z/VM.
The normal usage is to invoke vmcp with the command you want to
execute. If the 
.BI -k
option is not specified, the whole command line is automatically translated 
into uppercase. The response of z/VM is written to the standard output. 
 
.BI vmcp
needs a kernel feature represented by the device node /dev/vmcp.
The kernel module defines a buffer size, which limits the length of the 
response. Every output larger than the compiled buffer size is 
silently dropped.
Depending on you shell, please remember to escape special characters 
like * using \\* instead.
.SH RETURN CODES
vmcp writes the response to stdout and any error message to stderr.
Depending on the success one of the following return codes is returned:
.TP
.BR "0"
No problem in vmcp or CP.

.TP
.BR "1"
CP returned a non-zero response code.

.TP
.BR "2"
The specified buffer was not large enough to hold CP's response. The command
was executed, nevertheless, and the response was truncated. You can use the 
--buffer option to increase the response buffer.

.TP
.BR "3"
Linux reported an error to vmcp. See the error message for details.

.TP
.BR "4"
The options passed to vmcp were erroneous. See the error messages for details.

.fi
.P

If add the following line to /etc/sudoers

.BI "ALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/vmcp indicate"
