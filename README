         increase the lookup speed.

    - dasdinfo: Fix exit code handling
          For all kinds of errors exit code 1 is used now.

    - cmsfs-fuse: Fix configuration file string handling
          The configuration file string is freed twice. The double free
          can lead to unpredictable behaviour. Remove the superfluous free
          call.

          if qetharp is called with -6 or --ipv6 in conjunction with -q.

    - zfcpdbf: Adjust tool to 2.6.38 zfcp driver changes
          For the Linux kernel 2.6.38 the zfcp driver changed its tracing
          infrastructure. The zfcpdbf tool is updated to work with
          the new trace data. Note that the new tool will not be able to
          process zfcp traces from kernels older than 2.6.38.

          * Prevent segmentation fault if $HOME is undefined

    - hyptop: Fix man page typo ('r' = current weight)

    - hyptop: Prevent interactive mode on s390 line mode terminals
          To prevent hyptop starting in interactive mode on line mode
          terminals, the TERM variable is checked. If TERM is unset
          or set to "dumb" interactive mode is not allowed.

    - cpuplugd: Fix multiplication in rule expressions

1.12.0
    Added new tool:
    - hyptop

    Changes of existing tools:
    - cio_ignore: Add new option -i / --is-ignored
          Add an option to the cio_ignore tool which can be used to determine
          if a device with a given ID is on the blacklist:

          # cio_ignore --is-ignored 0.0.0190
          Device 0.0.0190 is ignored

          # cio_ignore --is-ignored 0.0.0009
          Device 0.0.0009 is not ignored

    - cmsfs-fuse: Add support for configuration file
          Add a configuration file for automatic translation from EBCIDC
          to ASCII based on the file type.

    - tunedasd: Add new option -Q / --query_reserve
          The new option -Q / --query_reserve can be used to determine the
          reservation status of a device.

    - chreipl: Various enhancements
          * Add support to re-IPL from named saved systems (NSS)
          * Add support to specify additional kernel parameters for re-IPL
          * Add "auto target" support
          * Add support to re-IPL from device-mapper multipath devices

    - zgetdump: Add kdump support for --info option

    - zipl/zfcpdump_v2: Disable automatic activation of LUNs
          With Linux 2.6.37 all available ZFCP SCSI NPIV LUNs are automatically
          set online. For zfcpdump this has to be prevented because only the
          dump disk should be set online. To achieve this the zfcpdump
          application sets /sys/module/zfcp/parameters/allow_lun_scan
          to zero before setting the ZFCP device online.

    Bug Fixes:
    - dasdfmt: Fix buffer overrun in error message for option -b

    - cpuplugd: cmm_pages not set and restored correctly

    - lsluns: Fix LUN reporting for SAN volume controller (SVC)

    - lsluns: Uninitialized value on adapter offline
          An error message is presented stating that some values are not
          initialized while an operation is due. The program execution is not
          reflecting the offline adapter status. Account for offline adapter
          status and show an appropriate message

    - lsluns: Accept uppercase and lowercase hex digits

    - zgetdump: Add umount fallback for --umount option
          If the fusermount is not installed, zgetdump now tries the umount
          command as second choice to unmount a directory.

    - fdasd/dasdfmt: Fix format 7 label
          Backups of Linux on System z disks from z/OS do not work when the
          disk is not fully partitioned. The format 7 label written by fdasd
          and dasdfmt is incorrect. The extend for free space has one track
          less than required which is recognized as inconsistent vtoc state
          by z/OS tools. Fix libvtoc to write the format 7 label correctly.

1.11.0
    Changes of existing tools:
    - cmsfs-fuse: Add write support
          With this support it is possible to add, delete, and modify CMS
          files under Linux.

    - zipl: Add support for automatic menus
          When the keyword 'defaultauto' is specified in the defaultboot
          section of a zipl.conf file, zipl will automatically build and
          install a boot menu including all IPL sections listed in the
          configuration file.

    - cpuplugd: Code cleanup for messages

    - all: Add gcov build support
          Extend the s390-tools build system to support gcov-based code
          coverage measurements. To use gcov on a compiled tool, perform
          these steps:
          1. # make G=1
          2. Run the tool
          3. # gcov file.c (where file.c is the source code file for which
                            code coverage data is requested)
          4. Analyze gcov output written to file.c.gcov
          See the gcov man page for a description of the gcov output format.
          Note: gcov is only available for tools written in C and C++

    Bug Fixes:
    - dumpconf: Redirect stdout/stderr to prevent "startpar" hangs

    - zfcpdbf: Rename --dates option
          Rename "--date" to "--dates" as documented in the man page.

    - chccwdev: Fix cio_settle usage when more than on device is changed
          The chccwdev tool can operate on lists of devices. If this feature
          is used, cio_settle is invoked too late. Use cio_settle prior to
          parsing the list of devices.

    - lsdasd: Fix return code of -h option

    - ziomon: Fix return codes for -h and -v options

    - ziomon: Replace deprecated "df -m" by "df -B 1M"
          ziomon uses GNU df with the option -m. This option is deprecated. It
          is replaced by the option "-B 1M".

    - zipl dump tools: Add retry logic for subchannel status
          In order to recover from failures like interface-control checks,
          we now retry the I/O, if the subchannel status is not equal to "0".

    - zipl: Check for maximum parmline size
          Parmlines which exceeds the maximum size are truncated during IPL
          which might cause problems.

    - zipl: Fix heap overflow when installing large menus
          Prevent zipl from writing menus with more than 50 entries to memory
          beyond the allocated heap buffer.

    - ttyrun: Fix argument parsing for upstart jobs
          ttyrun fails if you use the -e option in combination with a terminal
          that is specified using an absolute path.

1.10.0
    Changes of existing tools:
    - znetconf: Add support for new CHPIDs OSX and OSM

    - chchp: Use /proc/cio_settle
          "cio_settle" ensures that all previously started CIO actions are
          handled. This feature is now used in chchp and ensures that after
          chchp returns, subsequent work of the requested action is completed
          e.g. (de)registration of devices.

    Bug Fixes:
    - ziomon: Fix the execution of stat <file> to follow symlinks
          Otherwise a false major:minor number is returned and the script
          fails to resolve the matching multipath-, SCSI-device combination.

    - znetconf: Fix -d|--driver option to work with latest versions of bash

    - cpuplugd: Fix cmm_min/max limit checks
          The cmm_min and cmm_max limits are not enforced correctly,
          when starting the daemon without the -V option or when
          cmm_pages is set manually below or above the limits.
          This patch makes the checks independent from the -V option
          and adds a check for cmm_pages beyond the limit.

    - cpuplugd: Set cpu_min to 1 by default
          With a cpu_min default value of 2 the "cpu ping pong" effect
          may still be visible with low system load, i.e. expensive CPU 
          signaling may occur if the workload is spread on 2 under-worked
          CPUs. Therefore the default value of cpu_min is set to 1 now.

    - cpuplugd: Fix stack overwrite
          cpuplugd will terminate with "stack smashing" error on systems with
          more than 30 CPUs. The NULL termination of a read buffer will write
          beyond the buffer if a previous read() filled out the whole buffer.
          This is fixed by reading only maximum buffer size - 1 bytes.
          Also fixed some initialization errors discovered by valgrind.

    - cmsfs-fuse: Fix variable record file length ending with a null block
          If a variable record file ends with a null block, the whole block is
          counted. That results in a wrong file size since only the length
          as given in the variable header may be used from the null block.
          Correct the file size by calculating the used bytes from the
          record data of the last block.

    - cmsfs-fuse: Fix memory leak in freeing cached file data

    - iucvterm - iucvtty: Install signal handler for the interrupt signal
          An established IUCV terminal connection is not disconnected when
          iucvtty has been started in foreground and the user triggers an
          SIGINT.  The parent process (iucvtty) exits but the child process
          keeps running. However, handle SIGINT and stop the child process.

    - iucvterm - iucvtty: Do not specify z/VM user IDs for the login program
          Login programs use -h to specify the host name of the originator.
          iucvtty passes the z/VM user ID for this option that might cause
          DNS timeouts if the target system cannot reach any DNS servers.

    - vmur: Revised man page and added vmur examples

    - ip_watcher - xcec-bridge: Fix multicast forwarding
          xcec-bridge was developed for the packet socket support of the qeth
          layer 3 driver. The code assumes there are no link level headers for
          incoming packets. The new qeth layer 3 driver has full packet socket
          support so xcec-bridge has to account the link level header.
          Note that this version will not be able to run with kernels older
          than 2.6.26.

    - zfcpdbf: Fix "Use of uninitialized value" and output issues,
          add devno and timestamp to output of "status read" and
          remove output of LS field for ELS requests; it was wrong,
          and newer dbf does not have this redundant field.

    - qethconf: Fix "ipa list" function to display devices with
          subchannel set != 0

    - vmconvert: Fix dump conversion problem for z/VM guests with DCSSes
          For VMDUMPs of z/VM guests with DCSSes vmconvert used the
          wrong storage size.

    - chccwdev: Fix --attribute option

    - chccwdev: Print message if no driver is attached to a device

1.9.0
    Added new tools:
    - cmsfs-fuse
    - ttyrun
    - lsmem/chmem

    Changes of existing tools:
    - zgetdump: Add dump conversion and mount support
          The zgetdump tool can be used now for dump format conversion.It can
          read ELF, s390, and LKCD and write ELF and s390 format dumps.
          A mount option based on "fuse" is added to zgetdump that allows dumps
          to be converted in memory on the fly without the need of copying
          them. The following two options are added to zgetdump:
          * fmt: Specify output dump format (elf or s390)
          * mount: Mount dump instead of copying it to standard output

    - zgetdump: Remove multi-volume tape dump support
          The capacity of todays tape cartridges is big enough for dumping
          large systems. Therefore multi-volume tape dump support is no longer
          needed.

    - lsqeth: Add new qeth attribute "sniffer"

    - chccwdev, cio_ignore: Use /proc/cio_settle
          "cio_settle" ensures that all previously started CIO actions are
          handled. This feature is used now in chccwdev and cio_ignore and has
          the following effects:
          * chccwdev:
            Devices can be attached and set online afterwards with chccwdev
            without the need of a delay between the commands.
          * cio_ignore:
            After cio_ignore returns it is now ensured that the requested
            action is completed.

    - zfcpdump_v2/vmconvert: Add CPU lowcore pointers to asm dump header
          By adding the CPU lowcore pointers to the dump header we now
          can access the CPU registers in dumps without needing the
          System.map symbol information.

    Bug Fixes:
    - ziomon: Allow ziorep_config to be installed to different directories
          The path for ziorep_config has been hard-coded to
          "/sbin/ziorep_config" and it was checked to detect install errors.
          However distributions may install these files in varying directories.
          With this patch this is possible now, because the hardcoded path is
          no longer necessary. ziorep_config now has to be installed to a
          directory that is in the PATH variable of the caller.

    - ziomon: Fix problem with long multipath device names
          When tracing multipath devices with long names, e.g.
          /dev/mapper/360050768018f8267c800000000000008, parsing of the 'df'
          command output can break and result in syntax error messages on
          the command line.

    - ziomon: Fix problem with multipath command output
          Some versions of the multipath command use characters that can
          break parsing of its output, ultimately leading to error messages
          like:
            ziomon: Number of LUNs does not match number of devices: 12
                    devices and 10 LUNs

    - zipl/zfcpdump: Use "cgroup_disable=memory" kernel parameter
          The zfcpdump kernel has to run within a 32 MB limit. When using
          "memory cgroups" about 2.6 MB are allocated, which can lead to
          "out of memory" kernel panic during SCSI dump. For zfcpdump we do
          not need "memory cgroups". Therefore it is disabled via the zfcpdump
          kernel parameter line.

    - zipl: Fix tape IPL failure
          IPL from tape after prepared by zipl stops with a disabled wait PSW.
          zipl did not provide a reasonable address of an initrd to the loader.

    - lsdasd: Add missing description of option -b to man page

    - lsqeth: Determine sysfs mount point using /proc/mounts

    - lsqeth: Clear print array for every device displayed

    - lsluns: Move lsluns from /sbin to /usr/sbin
          The lsluns tool uses perl that normally is installed under
          "/usr/bin". According to LSB we also have to install the lsluns
          tool to "/usr".

    - iucvterm: Allow non-alphanumeric characters when parsing group names

    - zfcpdump_v2: Use direct-IO for writing dumps
          Using direct-IO for zfcpdump has two major advantages compared
          to normal IO that uses the Linux page cache:
          * On recent Linux kernel versions it is faster on small systems.
          * Because no page cache is used, less memory is consumed.

1.8.4
    Added new tools:
    - 60-readahead.rules: udev rules to set increased "default max readahead"
          The current "default max readahead" defined by the kernel is too
          small for s390. Add udev rule to set a better default value. This
          will increase sequential read performance up to 40%.

    Changes of existing tools:
     - zipl: Improve I/O error recovery during IPL
          Change the boot loader code to handle temporary path errors and link
          flapping during IPL.

     - zipl: Remove DEFAULT_RAMDISK_ADDRESS
          Using the default value has been replaced by calculating the address
          dependent on the image size.

     - lsqeth: Introduce "lay'2" column for "lsqeth -p"
          Add new qeth attribute "isolation".

     - qethconf: Indicate command failure and show message list
          When qethconf detects a bad exit status of its issued echo
          command, an error message is presented to the user.
          In addition possible reasons for command failure can be
          listed with "qethconf list_msg".

     - dumpconf: Prevent re-IPL loop for dump on panic
          A new DELAY_MINUTES keyword is introduced in the dumpconf
          configuration file. The keyword delays the activation of dumpconf to
          prevent potential re-IPL loops.

     - dbginfo: Add new attributes

    Bug Fixes:
     - cpuplugd: Fix file handling in get_cmmpages_size()

     - fdasd, dasdinfo, tunedasd: Fix handling of read-only devices
          A as long as a tool does not require write access do a block device,
          it should open the device in read-only mode. Otherwise opening the
          device may fail, and usability of the tool on read-only devices is
          unnecessarily restricted.

     - fdasd: Fix auto mode behavior
          Fix the misbehavior of fdasd in case the -a or -i option is specified
          and the label block is broken. Previously it asked interactively for
          a new label. Now it exits with an error message.

     - dasdview, fdasd: Fix floating point error for unformatted devices
          When executed on an unformatted device the tools dasdview and fdasd
          will end with an floating point exception error.
          The reason for the error lies in the fact that we cannot rely on the
          HDIO_GETGEO ioctl to report a correct number of cylinders and so we
          compute the number of cylinders from the device size. However,
          for unformatted devices the device size is zero and thus our
          computation ends with a floating point exception.
          To solve this issue read the correct number of cylinders from
          the DASD device characteristics, which can be found in the data
          returned by the BIODASDINFO ioctl.

     - libvtoc: Fix string overflow in vtoc_volume_label_init()
          Originally it tries to copy a 84B string into 4B field and reset also
          the other fields through the overflow. This doesn't work with recent
          GCC versions.

     - mon_statd: Improve init script
          * stop: Do not print error messages if a daemon is not configured.
          * start: Do not load module if no daemon is configured.
          * Remove useless newlines.

     - lscss: Fix uppercase conversion (appeared with -u option)

     - lstape: Help function returns 1, although it was successful
          Changed exit status of "lstape --help" from 1 to 0.

     - znetconf: Index into chpidtype lookup table must be hex
          Network subchannels with CHPID type containing non-decimal digits,
          i.e. a-f, cause lsznet.raw errors. The value of the sysfs attribute
          "type" of a CHPID is hex, but the lookup table index in the bash
          script must be decimal. To solve the problem, we now
          interpret "type" as hex number when used as lookup table index.

     - chreipl: Fix SIGSEGV in "chreipl node"
          When calling "chreipl node /dev/dasdxy" chreipl crashes with SIGSEGV.
          The problem is a missing check in get_ccw_devno_old_sysfs(). Besides
          of that at two places strncpy() was called with the wrong size.

     - chshut: Disable panic action
          The panic action should be configured using the dumpconf service.
          Therefore we disable the possibility to configure it with chshut in
          order to avoid conflicts.

     - lsreipl: Add missing NSS support

     - vmconvert: Ensure null termination of progress bar string
          The progress bar shows control characters at end of line, because
          one variable responsible for the progress bar has not been
          initialized. We now initialize this variable correctly.

     - vmconvert, zfcpdump_v2: Set correct LKCD end marker flag

     - zfcpdump_v2: Ignore failure of modprobe
          It is possible that all modules are built-in the zfcpdump kernel.
          Therefore modprobe of those modules will fail and we must not
          check the return value.

     - ziomon: ziorep_traffic/utilization return 1 when called with -h & -v
          These two tools return 1 when -h or -v are used as arguments. Changed
          the return code in these cases to 0.

     - zipl: zfcp dump partition error
          The info structure was used after it was freed. This leads to wrong
          partition information on the zfcp dump device. Therefore SCSI
          dumps may fail. To fix this, we free the info structure after last
          usage.

1.8.3
    Changes of existing tools:
     - zipl: Add support for device mapper devices.
         Allow installation of and booting from a boot record on logical
         devices, i.e. devices managed by device mapper (or similar products),
         e.g. multipath devices.

1.8.2
    Added new tools:
    - znetconf
    - cio_ignore

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dasdview: Add solid state device support.
         Extend the -c option to show if a disk is a solid state device or not.

    - lscss: Also show devices on the defunct subchannel.

    - all: Reworked s390-tools build process.

    Bug Fixes:
    - dumpconf: Validate DEVICE keyword, enhance error handling.
         The DEVICE keyword is accepted in both devno and bus-ID syntax.
         In case of invalid keywords the corresponding error messages are more
         precise.

    - zipl: Ensure that zipl is built with non-executable stack.
         The ".note.GNU-stack" section is lost when the boot loaders in zipl
         are built. The reason is that objcopy removes all sections except
         of the text section: $(OBJCOPY) -O binary --only-section=.text $< $@
         When the linker finds a object file without the .note.GNU-stack
         section, it forces the binary to have executable stack.
         To fix the problem, the noexecstack option is used in the link step.

    - zipl: "zipl --help" does not mention "--force".
         Add information on the "--force" option introduced together with
         "--mvdump".

    - zipl: Don't use "Error" if user answered zipl confirmation prompt with no
         For several operations zipl issues a confirmation prompt such as
         "Do you want to continue creating a dump partition (y/n)".
         If the user disagrees, there should be no error indication in the
         "Operation canceled by user." message.

    - zipl:
         * Exit when trying to run zipl on an unknown device type.
         * Skip check for invalid geometry on FBA devices.
         * Fix use after free error when installing a multi-volume dump.

    - vmur, ziomon tools: Install tools under "/usr/sbin" instead of "/sbin".
         Because vmur and ziomon use libstdc++ that normally is installed under
         "/usr/lib", we have to install the tools under "/usr/sbin".

    - cpuplugd: Fix cmm_pages allocation.
         Fix cmm_pages allocation outside min and max limitation.

    - dasdinfo:
         * Strip trailing spaces from volume serials with less then 6
           characters.
         * Read volume serials also from CMS formatted disks.

    - lsluns:
         Fixed disk encryption check that is performed when the new "--active"
         command line switch is used.

         have more than one word.

    - all:
         Fixed a lot of build warnings and minor bugs.

1.8.1
    Added new tools:
    - iucvterm

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dump tools: Add support for "Automatic IPL after dump"
         Kernels supporting the new shutdown action "dump_reipl" allow to
         specify a re-IPL device that should be used after dump. To
         exploit this feature the following tools have been updated:
         - zipl dump tools:
           Trigger IPL after dump, if specified.
         - zfcpdump:
           Trigger IPL after dump, if specified.
         - dumpconf:
           Allow to specify "dump_reipl" in case a kernel panic occurs.

    - DASD related tools: Add Large Volume Support for ECKD DASDs
         The DASD device driver with "Large Volume Support" allows to access
         ECKD DASD devices with more than 65520 cylinders. To exploit this
         feature the following tools have been updated:
         - dasdfmt
         - fdasd
         - dasdview
         - zipl
         - zipl dump tools

    - ziomon: Add report utilities
         New tools ziorep_config, ziorep_traffic and ziorep_utilization
         for performance data report generation are added.

    - vmur: Add "--convert" option
         With this option a VMDUMP file can be converted into the LKCD dump
         format while receiving it from the z/VM reader. LKCD dumps
         can be processed by the Linux dump analysis tools lcrash and crash.

    - lsluns: Add "--active" option
         With this option all activated LUNs are shown. In addition LUN
         encryption information is provided.

    - dasdview: Add "--characteristic" option
         With this option a list of hardware specific DASD characteristics is
         shown. Currently only the encryption status is shown, this may
         be extended for future releases.

    - tunedasd: Normalize profile data
         Change the scaling of DASD profile data from binary to decimal
         shifting. Also print the scaling factor.

    - qetharp, qethconf, osasnmpd and lsqeth:
         removed 2.4 supporting code

    - dasdfmt: Add "--norecordzero" option
         With this option the permission for the subsystem to format record
         zero is removed.

    - dasdfmt: Add "--percentage" option
         With this option one line for each formatted cylinder is printed
         showing the number of the cylinder and percentage of formatting
         process.

    Bug Fixes:
    - zipl dump tools:
         The 31-bit dump tools did not update the address portion of the
         disabled wait psw with the error code. This omission has been fixed.

    - zipl dump tools:
         FBA dump tool can only dump up to 4GB. When dumping a Linux system
         with more than 4GB on a FBA disk, a corrupt dump is generated, where
         the first 4GB of memory are repeatedly dumped. The problem is that
         the dumper code uses two 32 bit instructions, where 64 bit
         instructions are required. To fix the problem 64 bit instructions are
         used now.

    - Remove -s option from install sections in Makefiles
         Because the binaries have been stripped in the install step, the
         debug info was not available for rpmbuild. Therefore the -s option
         has been removed now.

    - Improve LSB (Linux Standard Base) compliance of init scripts

    - tape390_display:
         The command  "tape390_display <message1> <message2> <node>" can cause
         message "stack smashing detected" if <message2> contains exactly
         eight characters. This stack overwrite has been fixed.

    - lscss:
         Don't print newline for availability attributes containing blanks.

    - chccwdev:
         Suppress bash error message, if device is gone between test and
         read of online attribute. Exit with error if no device was found
         in a given range.

    - chccwdev, lscss, lstape:
         Add missing "-v" and "-V" (lstape) options.

    - chchp:
         Improve value checking.

    - dasdinfo:
         Fix handling of new sysfs layout. Due to changes in the sysfs
         dasdinfo did not find a block device to a given busid. Changed
         dasdinfo to accept the new and the old sysfs layout.

1.8.0
    Added new tools:
    - ipl_tools (lsreipl, chreipl, lsshut, chshut)
    - ziomon tools
    - lszcrypt
    - chzcrypt
    - lsluns

    Changes of existing tools:
    - zfcpdump_v2: Add support for memory holes
         zfcpdump was not prepared to deal with multiple, non-contiguous
         storage extents. This shortcoming has been fixed by introducing
         a new debugfs file zcore/memmap which contains information on
         start address and length of memory chunks.

    - zfcpdump_v2: Update to latest e2fsprogs (1.41.3) and kernel (2.6.27)
         versions.

    - zipl: Support for virtio devices
         This feature allows zipl to prepare virtio devices for ipl and dump.

    - zipl dump tools: Add multi volume support
         This feature adds the ability to dump on multiple ECKD DASD devices,
         which can be necessary, if the system memory size is larger than
         the size of a single DASD device.

    - lscss: Support for non I/O subchannels
         lscss now shows non I/O subchannels. New options to limit the output
         to ranges of subchannels or devices have been added.

    - lstape: Add SCSI tape support
         With this feature it is now possible to list installed SCSI tapes
         besides channel attached tapes.

    - ip_watcher: New qeth driver support
         Adapt ip_watcher to support sysfs interface of the qeth driver.
         This is necessary to support the new implementation of the qeth driver
         (kernel 2.6.26).

    - osasnmpd: New qeth driver support
         Adapt osasnmpd to new implementation of qeth driver (kernel 2.6.26),
         which does no longer offer the sysfs attribute notifier_register.
         Notification of added or removed OSA-cards now has to be done in
         user space (udev). The udev rule file '57-osasnmpd.rules' is
         provided now in the s390-tools package.

    - dbginfo.sh:
         Collect additional system information.

    Bug Fixes:
    - zipl dump tools:
         The tape dump tool provided incorrect input for the progress message.
         For memory sizes larger than 4G the progress message display stopped
         at 3584M thus leaving the user in doubt, whether the dump tool is
         still dumping or not.

    - zfcpdump_v2:
         With kernels 2.6.26 or above, the port_add attribute has been
         removed which caused "Dump to SCSI disk" to fail with following
         message:
            ERROR: Could not open /sys/bus/ccw/drivers/zfcp/<bus_id>/port_add
            No such file or directory 
         This has now been fixed.

    - lsdasd:
        - correct presentation of DASD HPAV alias devices 
        - improve performance of script
        - correct bug with non-privileged users
        - adaption to sysfs rules
        - improve usability

    - cpuplugd/mon_statd:
         Fix "Required Start/Stop" dependencies.

    - cpuplugd:
         A bug which prevented CPUs from being set online again after
         /etc/init.d/cpuplugd reload and restart has been fixed.

1.7.0:
    Changes of existing tools:
    - zipl: IPL-retry on IFCC.
         This feature causes the hardware to retry a CCW IPL operation on an
         alternate channel-path if an interface-control check is detected
         during execution of the CCW IPL operation.

    - zipl: Boot menu can be used to replace kernel parameter string
         zipl's boot menu for DASD devices has been changed to allow replacing
         the complete kernel parameter string with user input when the first
         character of user input is an equal sign ('=').

    - cpuplugd: Enhanced configuration file parser
         The parser of cpuplugd has been enhanced to provide more hints to
         the user at which entry in the configuration file a configuration
         error occurred.

    - dumpconf: Add VMCMD support
         The dumpconf init script now exploits the new "shutdown actions
         interface" introduced with vanilla Linux kernel 2.6.25. Up to
         five VM commands can be specified to be triggered in case of
         a kernel panic.

    - mon_fsstatd: Remove init script and sysconfig file
         mon_fsstatd init script and sysconfig file are replaced by
         mon_statd, which controls both monitor daemons mon_fsstatd and
         mon_procd.

    - lszfcp: Source code cleanup

1.6.3:
    Added new tool:
    - cpuplugd

    Changes of existing tools:
    - dasdinfo: New -x/--extended-uid option.
         With the PTF for APAR VM64273 installed, z/VM provides a unique
         identifier that allows to distinguish between virtual disks which
         are defined on the same real device. This identifier will be part
         of the UID. To allow for an easier upgrade, the original -u/--uid
         option will print the UID without this token and the
         -x/--extended-uid will return the full UID.

1.6.2:
    Added new tools:
    - vmur
    - lschp
    - chchp
    - zfcpdump_v2
    - mon_procd (with new mon_statd init script and sysconfig file)

    Changes of existing tools:
    - Use "-O3" compile option for all tools.
    - Update zipl to enable zfcpdump_v2.

1.6.0:
    Added new tools:
    - tape390_crypt
    - mon_fsstatd
    - dumpconf
    - dasdinfo
    - 59-dasd.rules

    Changes of existing tools:
    - DASD/Tape dump tools:
      SCLP console support to show dump progress on the operator console.

    - zgetdump:
      New -d option to check if DASD is a valid dump device.

    - No more XML in zfcpdump:
      Because XML is going to be obsolete, we now use the binary parameter
      block provided by the hardware to find out on which scsi disk the dump
      should be created.

    - dbginfo.sh:
      Collect additional system information.

    - No libsysfs in DASD tools:
      It turned out that using libsysfs is less stable than using the sysfs
      attributes directly. Therefore the libsysfs dependency has been removed.

    - Removed '-c' option of lsqeth.

    - Unification of 'invalid option' error messages, Makefiles and "-v" output
      for all tools.

1.5.2:
    Added new tools:
    - lszfcp
    - scsi_logging_level

1.5.0:
     Added new tool:
     - vmcp: tool for accessing the control program of z/VM using the
          kernel module 'vmcp'.

     - zfcpdbf: perl script to filter ZFCP debug (DBF) data.

     Added new features for existing tools:
     - vmconvert: 64bit support.
          Enhance vmconvert that it can convert the new 64bit format
          z/VM dumps in addition to the old format dumps.

     - osasnmpd: implement long options
          For for all options now also long options have been implemented
          using the "getopt_long" function.

     - dasdxxxx: DASD tool harmonization
          Some changes are applied to dasdfmt, fdasd and dasdview either to
          make the syntax more common to other Linux tools or to introduce
          small enhancements to get better usability.

     - zfcpdump: Update SCSI System Dumper
          Replaced the old Linux 2.4.19 kernel with Linux 2.6.12 and
          e2fsprogs version 1.32 with version 1.37.
          The busybox will be removed completely, since the functionality
          provided by busybox will be implemented manually.

     - dbginfo.sh: collect additional debug output.
          fixed collection of s390dbf files which moved to debugfs.
          Changed behavior when trying to detect the kernel version.

1.4.0:
     Added new tool:
     - zconf/lsqeth: shell script to list all QETH based networking devices

     Added new features for existing tools:
     - dbginfo.sh: collect additional debug output,
          corrected/changed command line handling

     - zipl: added --dry-run function
          This function can be used to simulate a zipl run without modifying
          an existing IPL record.

     - zipl: dump support for memory holes. Enables dumping for z/VM guests
          with fragmented storage (defined with z/VM command
          'define storage config').

     - dasd tools: minor enhancements, rework and harmonization of the
          command line options

1.3.2: Added new tool:
     - vmconvert
     Added new features for existing tools:
     - zipl: FBA dump support

1.3: Added new tools:
     - zconf (chccwdev,lscss,lsdasd,lstape)
     - tunedasd

     Added new features for existing tools:
     - zipl: multi boot, IPL from tape, custom dump size limit
     - dbginfo.sh: adaptions for Linux 2.6

1.2.2: Added new tool:
     - ip_watcher/start_hsnc

1.2: Added new tools:
     - qethconf
     - zfcpdump

     Added new features for existing tools:
