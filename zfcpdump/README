zfcpdump: SCSI System Dumper
==============================================================================

Overview:
=========

With this package it is possible to create linux system dumps on SCSI disks.
The prerequisite to create dumps with zfcpdump is that the zSeries machine 
has installed the "list directed dump" feature. Your machine has this 
feature, if the load panel on the HMC provides a "list directed dump" radio 
button. VM does currently not support "list directed dump".
 
Build zfcpdump:
===============

In order to build zfcpdump, three external packages must be copied to the 
"extern" directory:

	- e2fsprogs   : mesh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/e2fsprogs
	- linux-2.6.12: http://www.kernel.org

Currently the following tarballs of the packages are required:

- e2fsprogs-1.37.tar.gz  
- linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2

The script 'get_files.sh' can be used to get the required files from the 
internet.  You may edit the file 'config' in order to setup your http proxy.

zfcpdump can be built using a romfs or ext2 ramdisk. This can be specified
in the config file setting RD_FS to 'romfs' (default) or 'ext2'. In order
to use romfs the program 'genromfs' (see http://romfs.sourceforge.net/) has
to be installed on the build system. The advantage of romfs is that
zfcpdump can be built without being root. If ext2 is used, zfcpdump has
to be built as root, since the mount command is needed, which normally
requires root privileges.

Call 'make' to build zfcpdump!
