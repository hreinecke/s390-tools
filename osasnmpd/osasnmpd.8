osasnmpd \- IBM OSA-Express network card SNMP subagent.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBosasnmpd\fR [-h] [-v] [-f] [-l \fIlogfile\fR | -L]  [-A] [-P \fIpidfile\fR]
[-x \fIagentx-socket\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBosasnmpd\fR is an SNMP subagent for the ucd-snmp 4.2.x package
and the net-snmp 5.1.x package.
It supports the MIBs provided by an IBM OSA-Express network card.
The subagent communicates via the AgentX protocol with the snmpd daemon.
Hence the snmpd daemon must be already started on the same system before
osasnmpd can start successfully.

\fB-x\fR \fIagentx-socket\fR
Uses the specified socket as AgentX connection rather than the 
default '/var/agentx/master'. The socket can either be a Unix 
domain socket path, or the address of a network interface.
If a network address of the form inet-addr:port is given, then
the subagent will use the port specified. If a network address 
of the form inet-addr is given, then the subagent will use the
default AgentX port, 705.
The agentx sockets of the snmpd daemon and osasnmpd must match.
