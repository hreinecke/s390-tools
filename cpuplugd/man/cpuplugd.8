.SH NAME
cpuplugd \- Linux on System z CPU and memory hotplug daemon
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpuplugd
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The cpuplugd daemon dynamically enables and disables CPUs and increases or
decreases the cooperative memory management (CMM) page pool based on a set of
rules.

When the daemon is stopped, the size of the CMM page pool and the number
of active CPUs are reset to the values they had before the cpuplugd was started.

This program can be used to control the number of CPUs for Linux on z/VM
and for Linux in LPAR mode. The memory hotplug feature (CMM page pool) applies
to Linux on z/VM only.
