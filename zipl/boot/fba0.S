# Startup for IPL at address 0
# Second stage boot loader is loaded to 0x2000 and starts at 0x2008
#
# The first 24 bytes are loaded by IPL to addresses 0-23 (PSW and two CCWs).
# The CCWs on 8-23 are used as a continuation of the implicit IPL channel
# program.
# The 1st CCW reads block 0 again with READ IPL
# The 2nd CCW tics to the re-loaded stage 1 IPL record.
