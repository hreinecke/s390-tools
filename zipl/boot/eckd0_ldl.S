# Startup for IPL at address 0
# Second stage boot loader is loaded to 0x2000 and starts at 0x2008
#
# The first 24 bytes are loaded by IPL to addresses 0-23 (PSW and two CCWs).
# The 1st CCW rewinds to record zero (read record zero)
# The 2nd CCW reads stage 1 IPL record (re-read record 1) and continues with
# command chaining at address 0x18
